NOTICE posted 30 December 2019

I am archiving much of my old code from when I was first learning to program.
The code in this repository is embarassingly bad, and it's not how I would
write code to do something similar today. Please don't take this repository
as an example of my programming habits and knowledge; look at my more recent
repositories instead.

# boi_programs
Some libraries and programs written in the Boi programming language, created by Dante Falzone, as well as a program for translating Boi into C++ (mistakenly called a "compiler").

IMPORTANT: Read the file `boiguide.txt`. It is a complete guide to the Boi programming language.
